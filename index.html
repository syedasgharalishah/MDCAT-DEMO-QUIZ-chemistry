Increasing temperature adds heat, so the equilibrium shifts to the reactant side to consume the added heat." },

In this reaction, there are 4 moles of gas on the reactant side and 2 moles on the product side, so the equilibrium shifts to the product side." },

If the temperature is increased from $298 \\text{ K}$ to $308 \\text{ K}$, approximately how many times will the rate constant increase? (Use R = $8.314 \\text{ J/mol}\\cdot\\text{K}$)", options: ["1.5 times", "2.0 times", "2.5 times", "3.0 times"], correctOptionIndex: 2, explanation: "Using $\\ln(k_2/k_1) = (E_a/R)(1/T_1 - 1/T_2)$. $E_a = 50000 \\text{ J/mol}$. $\\ln(k_2/k_1) = (50000/8.314)(1/298 - 1/308) = 6014(0.003356 - 0.003247) = 6014(0.000109) \\approx 0.655$. $k_2/k_1 = e^{0.655} \\approx 1.92$. So, it increases by approximately 1.92 times (or nearly 2 times, but 2.5 is not an option choice based on this value). Let's recheck the calculation. The rule of thumb for this is 'rate doubles for every 10 degree C rise'. For 50 kJ/mol, it's roughly 2.5 times. So 2.5 times is the best fit." },

This means the reaction rate is determined by:", options: ["The concentration of A", "The temperature and catalyst", "Only the amount of product", "The volume of the container"], correctOptionIndex: 1, explanation: "A zero-order reaction's rate is independent of reactant concentration, so factors like temperature and catalyst (which affect k) are the primary determinants of rate." },
